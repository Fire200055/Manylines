# Manylines
# So, what is this?
Manylines is a simple batch file that is intended to output how many lines there are in your C# project.
Just simply place the batch file into your Visual Studio projects folder and then you should be good to go!
# How do I use it?
As seen in the file, you can type '/n' to output how many lines of code are in the current directory; great for checking how much code you have written overall.

You can type in the project's directory to see how many lines of code has been written for that project alone, this includes the lines of .xaml files and .cs files.

Typing '/exit' closes the Command Prompt.

# Why did you decide to write this?
I wrote this because I could and I thought it would be useful.
